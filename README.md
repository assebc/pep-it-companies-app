# How to run the api

```sh
cd api

docker compose up -d #to start the dockers containers

npm install #install dependencies

npm start #start the api
```
Note: needs to be in administrator mod

# Requests collection

Inside the api folder is a file called `requests.json`. That file was exported from [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and if you want to see the endpoints created I recommend you to install insomnia and import that file.
