A simple platform for @porqueeuprogramo to improve streams' dynamic!

# .env file

- Go to the `api` folder and rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`
- Fill all the variables with the correct data to your local project and run the api

# How to run the api

```sh
cd api

docker compose up -d #to start the dockers containers

npm install #install dependencies

npm start #start the api
```

# Requests collection

Inside the api folder is a file called `requests.json`. That file was exported from [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and if you want to see the endpoints created I recommend you to install insomnia and import that file.
